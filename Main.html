    <p> Rollbacks, Reverts, Resets, and Rebasing
        Otherwise known as the “Rrrrgh!” chapter. Bad things happen to good people. Fortu‐
        nately Git can help you undo some of those past mistakes by rolling back time. There
        are several commands in Git which vary in their degree of severity—making minor
        adjustments of a commit message all the way through to obliterating history. Mistakes
        are typically committed, and removed, from an individual workstation, but the way they
        are dealt with can impact how others interact with the code base. Ensuring you are
        always dealing with problems in the most polite way possible will help your team work
        more efficiently.
        By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
        • Amend a commit to add new work.
        • Restore a file a previous state.
        • Restore your working directory to a previously committed state.
        • Revert previously made changes.
        • Reshape your commit history using rebase.
        • Remove a file from your repository.
        • Remove commits added to a branch from an incorrect merge.
        Throughout the chapter you will be learning techniques which feel invisible, but have
        huge implications. Take the time to slow down, and draw a diagram of how you want
        things to appear after you have run the sequence of commands. This will help you to
        select the right sub-command, and the right parameters. It will also help you to recall
        information the next time you need to perform the same task again.  </p>
